# üöó Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

An intelligent, real-time pricing engine for urban parking spaces using real-time traffic, vehicle, and demand data. This project leverages simulation, machine learning, and competitive pricing logic to dynamically update parking prices with fairness and efficiency.

## üìä Models Implemented

| Model | Name             | Basis                        | Formula Summary                                       |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **Occupancy-Based**  | Parking capacity utilization | `Price = Base + Œ± √ó (Occupancy / Capacity)`           |
| 2     | **Demand-Based**     | Real-time features + ML      | `Price = f(Occupancy, VehicleType, QueueLength, ...)` |
| 3     | **Competitor-Based** | Competitive pricing strategy | `Price = Avg(Model1, Model2) √ó Competitor Adjustment` |

## üìà Demand Function

We treat price as a **non-linear function** of key real-time features:

### üîß Variables Considered:
- `Occupancy`
- `VehicleType` (car, bike, truck, etc.)
- `QueueLength`
- `TrafficConditionNearby` (low / average / high)
- `IsSpecialDay`

### üìê Model 2 (Demand-Based ML Pricing)
```math
Price = f(Occupancy, QueueLength, VehicleType, TrafficCondition, IsSpecialDay)
